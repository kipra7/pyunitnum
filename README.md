# pyunitnum
Python and numpy library to simplify dimensional analysis and regulation between different systems of units (mainly for solid state physics.)

## What is Possible with This Library?: Some Examples

- Automatic dimensional analysis of some variables and constants
- Mutual conversion between systems of units (i.e. SI and CGS-gauss)
