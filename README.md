# pyunitnum
Python and numpy library to simplify dimensional analysis and regulation between different systems of units (mainly for solid state physics.)

## What is Possible with This Library?: Some Examples

- Calculations with automatic dimensional analysis of variables and constants (so you can avoid some calculation errors)
- Mutual conversion between systems of units (i.e. SI and CGS-gauss)
- Smooth integration with numpy, pandas, and xarray
